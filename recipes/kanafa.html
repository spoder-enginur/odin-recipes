    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>
      This kanafa, or knafeh, recipe is a favorite Palestinian dessert. Crunchy
      shredded phyllo dough is baked with a layer of creamy sweet cheese and
      then drenched in rosewater syrup. It's simple yet impressive. The cheese
      filling is traditionally made from Nabulsi cheese that is desalted. The
      ricotta-mozzarella mix is a great substitute, and lower-fat products can
      be used. If you have access to a Middle Eastern grocery, you can probably
      find kanafa dye, which turns the dough into the orange or reddish color
      that is the signature of kanafa.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Kanafa:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) box shredded phyllo dough (kataifi)</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>12 ounces unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Rosewater Syrup:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon rose water (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Prepare kanafa: Finely chop frozen, shredded phyllo dough using a food
        processor until the strands are about the size of a grain of rice. Pour
        into a large mixing bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Mix together ricotta, mozzarella, and sugar in a separate bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Place butter in a large, microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl
        with a spout. Heat in a microwave until completely melted, and let it
        sit for several minutes until a thick white foam has formed on top.
        Clarify butter by using a spoon to skim off the foam.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully pour butter into the bowl of phyllo dough. Avoid pouring in
        the white milk solids at the bottom of the clarified butter. Use your
        hands to mix butter and dough together. Make sure butter is absorbed by
        taking handfuls of the dough and rubbing it between your palms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly spread buttered phyllo dough into a 9x13-inch pan and firmly
        press it into the bottom and edges. Spread cheese mixture onto the
        dough, avoiding the edges of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is slightly golden and the
        edges of dough are brown and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the kanafa is baking, prepare the syrup: Combine 1 cup sugar and
        water in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high
        heat. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in lemon juice. Simmer,
        stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is
        thickened, 5 to 7 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture turn golden
        and caramelize. Remove from heat and add rose water; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove kanafa from the oven. Place a large platter or baking sheet over
        the baking dish. Using oven mitts, carefully invert the baking dish onto
        the platter so phyllo is on top. Pour syrup over kanafa. Cut into pieces
        and serve while hot.
