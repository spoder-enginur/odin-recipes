    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Palestinian salad can typically be found at the many falafel street stands
      all over Palestine. It is served on its own as a side dish or inside a
      pita sandwich wrap. This fresh, light, and colorful salad is sure to
      become a favorite for your family. Chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions,
      and parsley combine with a drizzled dressing of lemon juice, olive oil,
      garlic, and mint leaves. Goes great in a pita with falafel, hummus, and
      tahini, but also works as a side dish with any middle eastern, Greek, or
      even north African food.
