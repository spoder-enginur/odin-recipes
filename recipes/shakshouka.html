    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shakshuka (chakchouka or shakshouka) is a Tunisian dish of tomatoes,
      onions, pepper, spices, and eggs. It's usually eaten for breakfast or
      lunch, but I think it's tasty anytime. And it's easy to make. It is
      similar to the Turkish dish menemen and the Latin American breakfast dish
      huevos rancheros.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 ⅓ cups chopped onion</li>
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion, bell
        pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until vegetables have softened and
        onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, mix together tomatoes, chile pepper, cumin, paprika, and salt
        in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir tomato mixture into onion mixture. Simmer, uncovered, until tomato
        juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make 4 indentations in tomato mixture; crack eggs into indentations.
        Cover the skillet and cook until eggs are firm but not dry, about 5
        minutes.
